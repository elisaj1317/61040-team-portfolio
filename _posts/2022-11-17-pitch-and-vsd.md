# Pitch
 According to the USDA, 40% of food waste comes from households. Do you know what’s in the back of your fridge? How long has that leftover pasta been sitting hidden behind the takeout you keep ordering? Do you ever forget about food items until they’re moldy and have to be thrown out, contributing to food waste? With FridgeCheck, you’ll no longer lose track of items in your fridge or pantry! Simply input your groceries and meals, and our app will show you which ones are expiring next, and won’t remove anything from your “stockpile” until you remove it, indicating it’s no longer in your fridge growing moldy. Is something about to go bad, and you don’t have time to consume it? With FridgeCheck, you can easily create a “listing,” allowing others to purchase (or just take for free) your food items, so they don’t go to waste! Are you out of ideas for what to make with the items you have in your fridge? FridgeCheck can suggest recipes for you that use those ingredients. If you need a few extra ingredients to make the suggested meal, FridgeCheck will show you suggestions for who you can purchase or take the item from living communities you’re willing to pick up from! When you indicate you’ve made a recipe from that list, the items from your stockpile that that uses are automatically removed from your stockpile. With this new way to keep track of the food you’ve bought and tailored recipes to your fridge, FridgeCheck will help you keep mold out of your fridge and reduce food waste all around the world!

# VSD Analysis

## Stakeholders
**Direct Stakeholders.** 
*Those who directly interact with FridgeCheck are known as direct stakeholders. These direct stakeholders may have unique perspectives, skills, and concerns. In what key roles will individuals interact directly with FridgeCheck? (E.g., for a medical application, direct stakeholders would include the intake receptionist, physician, insurance agent.) Create a list of FridgeCheck’s direct stakeholders. For each stakeholder role, note at least one concern specific to that role.*  

The only direct stakeholders of FridgeTracker are MIT students, since we are limiting our application to this group. MIT students value *time*, so the tracker should not take a significant time on the user’s part to use. Also, if an ingredient suggested in a recipe is not within the student’s fridge, the relevant listings that the application suggests should not be far away from the student. To address this concern, we created communities within the larger category of MIT students, including one for each of the undergraduate dorms and off-campus students in the Cambridge or Boston area. Another concern of this direct stakeholder is *simplicity*. Many students are not going to spend hours thinking about what they should make for dinner with the ingredients they have in their fridge. FridgeCheck allows students to simply click a button and get a list of tailored recipes. A third concern for MIT students is *money*. FridgeCheck needs to provide recipes that maximize the number of ingredients from their fridge to limit the amount of food they are wasting and money they are throwing away.

**Non-targeted Use** 
*Technologies are not always used in ways that the designers intended. Who might use FridgeCheck for unplanned or nefarious purposes? In what ways might they do so?*  

The expiration tracker in FridgeCheck is meant for food items, but people can use it to track other items, including illegal goods. There currently is no planned verification for the type of good that can be entered in the tracker. This is a tradeoff we are choosing to make, because constraining this could lead to exclusion of food items from demographics and cultures that we as four designers cannot foresee.

Malicious users can also exploit the information on FridgeCheck to lure students. FridgeCheck’s listings of available food items or ingredients for giveaway is paired with the contact information of the donor, so users looking for items can contact the donor. Since users arrange meetups to deliver the ingredient in the listing and receive payment outside of the website, these are not verified meeting spots. Furthermore, malicious users can spam donors since contact information is displayed on the site for anyone who follows a user’s home community.

## Time
**Adaptation.**
*People are inherently adaptive, changing themselves or their behaviors in order to fit current conditions. Technologies can facilitate adaptation (e.g., a device that displays home energy use may encourage a homeowner to turn out the lights) or hinder adaptation (e.g., a person may be prevented from adopting a useful new technology if it is incompatible with other currently used technology). What is a lifestyle change that FridgeCheck could support? Does it inhibit any positive lifestyle changes, or encourage negative ones?*  

One positive lifestyle change of FridgeCheck users is greater awareness during grocery shopping. After coming home from a grocery shopping trip, users will input the grocery items into the website. This extra step requires more effort on the users’ part as the quantity of groceries increases. Thus, fewer groceries, especially unnecessary ones, will be purchased.

Considering the direct stakeholder, an MIT student, another positive lifestyle change is reducing food waste. A typical student usually has several options when it comes to meal times: go to a dining hall, buy food (either from a nearby restaurant or deliver food straight to the dorm), or cook a meal. FridgeCheck compels users to pursue the latter option through sorting of soon-to-expire food items. When cooking a meal, a student can choose to heat up some instant noodles, defrost some frozen food, or cook a fresh meal. The latter option requires greater activation energy than the easier options, but FridgeCheck’s Recipe concept provides meal suggestions based on existing ingredients in the fridge. Choosing to cook a fresh meal rather than instant noodles or frozen meals could increase the student’s nutrition and avoid food waste.

## Pervasiveness
**Widespread Use.** 
*A person's use of a technology may be impacted by how, when, and where other people are using it. How have interactions changed as use of FridgeCheck has spread from handfuls to thousands and then millions of users?  What new interactions might emerge as FridgeCheck continues to grow (e.g., to billions of users like Facebook)? Find three synergistic benefits of widespread use and three potential breakdowns.*

Synergistic benefits:
1. Food waste reduction
As the number of users grows on FridgeCheck, more users will be aware of the contents in the back of their fridges and create meals that use the ingredients they already have. This reduces food waste, as users will not throw out molding produce once a month or make an extra trip to the grocery store for a certain meal.
2. Cuisine understanding
Many people eat the same foods throughout the week (ex. [17% of British people ate the same lunch for two years](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/eating-the-same-thing-lunch-meal/584347/)). FridgeCheck’s recipe page would provide more diverse meal options to these individuals, empowering users with greater culinary creativity and understanding.
3. Community growth
When users do not have ingredients necessary for a recipe, they reach out to someone in their community. At scale, this can foster many connections and friendships between community members.

Potential breakdowns:
1. Community limitations
The community/communities included in FridgeCheck are limited to MIT. Widespread use of FridgeCheck outside of this college campus would immediately break down this aspect.
2. Diverse palettes
MIT alone has many cultural groups, including New House’s Spanish and German House. As cultural representation grows with more widespread use of FridgeTracker, the recipes suggested may not match the user’s desired type of food. For example, if the user has egg and rice in their fridge, they may want to make bibimbap, rather than egg fried rice or a burrito.
3. Too many listings
As scale increases, multiple people—even within a community—can have the same ingredient listed. Users may be frustrated that FridgeCheck does not provide optimized, nearby listings within community members.
