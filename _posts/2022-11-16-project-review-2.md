## Idea 1: MeetDeets
 
### Problem
We definitely understand the problem of planning in-person meetings! It can definitely be tedious. On your slide, you have "Who's coming / who can make it?". We spent some time discussing the different between the two, which is probably distracting from the main point. To make it clear, maybe choose one of those questions or separate each question into two separate bullet points. Though the picture is a stock photo, we think the picture on the problem slide does a great job of previewing the complexity of this compelling problem.
 
### Concepts and Operational Principle
 
The concepts involved in MeetDeets is clear, but we find it confusing that BaseInfo and Attendee are separate concepts. BaseInfo seems to include Time, and we would think both of these (who can meet and when to meet) are high debatable topics. Though, we are not totally sure what is included in BaseInfo.
 
One thing that we think is unclear is what info is up for suggestions and how to decide between suggestions. The sketch does a great job of showing how to create an event, but it seems like the user needs to set a Title, Time, and Description. Does this mean other people cannot propose alternate times? It is also unclear how users can suggest locations, but we think this will come together and be easy enough for users to execute!
 
MeetDeets could solve the problem. While the idea is similar to the Scheduling Assistant on Outlook, we think the adoption of a Google Maps-like SuggestThings concept can set this idea apart.
 
## Idea 2: FavShare
 
### Problem
Topic conversations is definitely a prevalent problem, though we could not think of the last time it personally happened to each of us. The images on this slide are funny. If the someone's breakfast looked like that, maybe they should bring it up! There is a compelling distinction in the problem between simple topic conversations that both people share versus *preferred* topics. This is an compelling problem that could optimize happiness during conversations!
 
### Concepts and Operational Principle
The concepts displayed on the slide were straightforward. However, we couldn't make out the pages on the navigation bar or submenus, so we would suggest to make them bigger in the wireframe, display them differently, or create a different slide each of these sections. While it is currently unclear how users add interests (probably because we cannot view the menus listed), the description on the slide makes it seem like it would be easy for users to execute.
 
These concepts can definitely help prompt conversation topics. A suggestion to address the problem of *preferred* conversation topics would be to have a little contest or ranking system within each category. For example, in Books, users can choose Harry Potter vs Outliers or The Giving Tree vs The Great Gatsby (like a BuzzFeed Quiz) and they can share results.
 
## Idea 3: Calial
 
### Problem
You spoke about the problem clearly. While we understand where you are coming from, we believe there are ways to host your calendar and see other people's calendars. For example, someone could [share their calendar](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-another-person-s-exchange-calendar-2257f515-408f-48ea-9363-11d0d5848c77). However, this is still a compelling problem, with multiple solutions (looks like you went a different route :)).
 
### Concepts and Operational Principle
 
We think the concepts are straightforward, and splitting up the concepts onto multiple slides made the operational principles more clear as well. We believe the users will have a easy time using the platform. This solution of hosting calendars on your social media page is such a clever adoption! These concepts merge together to form a coherent app. While it does not hold the same pros as current calendar apps listed on the problem slide, we believe this solves the cons. This could be a fun way to find events and check out what other people are up to! If you would like the calendar feature to be a focus of the app, you could make a page to list a compiled calendar of the user's closest friends and it could be cool to merge events added on Calial to Google Calendar / Apple Calendar / Outlook.
 
I think you definitely made the last slide work for you, like we talked about in class! Great job with that!
