# Overall feedback for Team MAST
 
Great ideas, and nice pitch video! Any of your ideas could make super interesting projects. Below is some feedback on the motivation and solution you presented for each of your ideas.
 
# Tune Trail
 
It wasn’t immediately obvious why the current recommendation algorithms such as those provided by Spotify fall short. Is there a particular reason it’s necessary to have people recommend different songs to their friends or others, as opposed to relying on an algorithm that takes into account each person’s music taste, and already contains information about relationships such as “liking song A usually means the user likes song B too”? What specifically is the issue with the current algorithm? It’s not obvious that getting recommendations from friends is the best way to learn about new music you’d like.
 
It seemed that this app could have been framed as “a new social media to connect people with similar music interests,” and that could have avoided confusion over what’s wrong with Spotify.
 
The concepts were clear. The concept of a Tune Trail was well-defined, with a clear purpose. Other than User, we weren’t super clear on what other concepts you’d need for this app, but the concepts make sense and the app seems like it would be coherent.
 
# Curator Central
 
The problem intuitively makes sense, but perhaps you could analyze some specific statistics to clearly showcase that museum engagement is an issue.
 
A slight concern would be that it’s possible Curator Central would turn museum visits into a scavenger hunt with people staring at their phones, or rushing around trying to “collect” all the artwork (i.e. scan all the QR codes) rather than truly enjoying it. Letting people annotate specific parts of each piece of artwork is super interesting and could be very effective; is there a way to maybe avoid encouraging people to “collect” and instead encourage people to analyze the pieces that they’re in front of and see what others have said about them? This wouldn’t really be a huge change to your concepts, maybe just not wording things as “collecting.”
 
Your app would likely make a huge difference in museum engagement, and your concepts were clear. This is a very interesting idea.
 
 
# Class Critique
 
The problem was clear, and it seems intuitive that it would be helpful to receive reviews online and on an ad-hoc basis. Showing us what the previous system for art critiques at MIT looked like helped us understand the issue.
 
Critiquing artwork while it’s in progress could be challenging, as it’s hard to just start over completely, and it could also be challenging to see the overall point of a piece of artwork until it’s almost complete. Maybe you could consider different types of critiques? Maybe you can request a critique on your idea, or on a sketch, and have these be different types of reviews, so it’s clear what type of feedback each artist is looking for for their piece.
 
This would be a coherent app, the concept of a Critique is clear, and the app would address the problem.
