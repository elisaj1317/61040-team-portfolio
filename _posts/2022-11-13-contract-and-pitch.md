# Team Contract

- Expected level of achievement and effort for each team member (what grades do you expect to get? how much time do you plan to put in?);
  - Try to get an A while maintaining good mental and physical health
  - Whatever is required to get the assigned part done for the shared goal of an impactful project that receives an A
  - 15 hr/week - 1 hr/week for prep for & team meeting w/ TAs = 14 hr/week (includes few hours of shared work and individual work)
- Personal goals for each team member (building a great app? learning a particular skill?);
  - All: Build an impactful and authentic website
  - Puja: Develop Vue, Vuex, and CSS skills to produce developed app
  - Elisa: Build on backend and frontend development skills
  - Monica: Improve front-end development skills and practice developing in Vue/Vuex
  - Ashley: Improve development skills in both front end and back end
- Frequency, length and location of team meetings;
  - 0.5 hrs of prep for TA meeting
  - 1 hr of check-in meeting (day before due date, convenient location like stud or dorm)
  - As needed (such as when we need to help each other debug), schedule meetings in a location that’s convenient given the time (such as stud if during usual lecture time, or one of our dorms if it’s at night)
- How quality of work will be maintained (reviewing each others’ code? team review meetings? pair programming?);
  - All work will be reviewed by at least one other member of the team
  - Look at code at meetings the day before the due dates
- How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed;
  - Collaboratively generate list of tasks needed to complete project
  - Open discussion to decide how to assign tasks
  - If deadlines are missed, reach out to person in-person / messenger and offer support and help because if one of us doesn’t finish something on time, it’s probably because we’re stuck and not because we didn’t care
- How decisions will be made and any disagreements resolved.
  - If there’s a decision we disagree on, try to think through pros and cons of each (including implementation time, complexity, and consumer benefit), then the decision gets made by majority vote. If tie, compromise if possible or rock paper scissors
