# Problem Definition
We think the problem suggested is interesting and is definitely relatable for many students. We wish there was more of a user story related to how the problem was presented, maybe explaining the perspective of an unmotivated student/worker. We feel it would be more compelling if the problem were presented as a real world experience. Another approach that could achieve a similar goal is presenting data on how motivation influences productivity. We think that expanding on the problem definition could help set up the solutions more effectively.

# Solution 1: Scoring
The concepts involved in scoring are clear, but we find it a little confusing how you would enforce the point system. How do you prevent students from creating fake tasks or submitting fake pictures from earning points? Also an even bigger issue is related to the sharing of work and plagiarism. Some classes do not allow students to collaborate on assignments or for students to share solutions, so how would your application give points on tasks that should not be shared publicly.

We think the concept of the notification could be effective, but we are not exactly sure how this would work. How would you ensure that a student received the notification in a timely manner? Would they have to be on the site to get the notification or would you ping their phone?

We think that there are still some ideas within Scoring that would need to be fleshed out to promote social accountability and reward users for the work they are doing. We think one thing to consider is how you would convince people to use the app since it may be an invasion of privacy to take a picture of your workspace.

# Solution 2: Bidding
We believe the concepts in bidding are a little vague. One thing that was not explained was the concept of bidding itself. Is the bid made by the user doing the task or the user monitoring the person doing the task? How does the payment process work? We think that the monetary component may dissuade people from joining the app. We think that the bidding process may seem like more of a punishment for people that suffer with ADHD rather than encouragement to stay on task.

We think that especially considering that you progress is judged solely by one individual this could lead to a large range of subjectivity. For example if a user suffers from ADHD or a mental disorder they may take more time to complete tasks, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they were not productive. This user may then be judged by someone who is a very fast learner and very productive and say they do not deserve to keep any of the money. We think that the bidding system can be easily abused in its current respect since it is solely based on one person’s opinion on another person’s work and has no checks and balances.

We think that although this could be an interesting idea, it seems infeasible to put a monetary weight on someone’s productivity.

# Solution 3: Blocking
The concepts involved in blocking are clear, but we find it a little confusing how you would enforce the locks. Does the blocking website have access to all of the user’s activity on a computer or phone? If, so this may be a violation of privacy and discourage people from using the site. It is a little unclear how the accountabuddy is supposed to hold the individual responsible. How is this different from iPhone usage reports that are generated weekly and the limits you can place on usage with that?

We think that this is definitely something that people could find useful, but we think that it may be unfeasible to implement given that it would have to monitor the person’s entire online activity. It is also a little unclear how this will make the student more motivated to do work. If a student blocks a specific site due to too much usage that doesn’t necessarily mean they will be more productive and motivated. For instance, if they spend too much time on TikTok and block it or set a time limit, they may just spend the time they save using Instagram.
