# Beta

## Task list

| **Task name** | **Goal** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Register | Create an account for yourself | User needs to create an account in order to use the web app. We hope to see how easily the user can create an account and if they find fields, like the home community, confusing. |
| Input raw ingredients | Add 2 cups of strawberries that go bad on 12/8/2022 and a dozen eggs that expire on 12/12/2022 | Most of the functionality relies on the user having food in their stockpile. We hope to find any inefficiencies with the process or any points of confusion with the units/quantity/expiration date |
| Input a cooked food | Add a Chipotle bowl that goes bad on 12/8 | For cooked food, users should indicate that it’s a prepared food so they should be unable to create listings. We want to see if the user will notice and click the prepared food checkbox.  |
| Follow communities | Indicate that you are willing to pick up items from Maseeh and McCormick | Recipe Listings will only appear if a user follows some communities. We want to see if the user will realize that they need to go to the Communities tab and follow those two communities. |
| Search recipe | Find a recipe to make that will use some of your food (click first option) | User can search for recipes with a button click without having any specific meal in mind.  |
| Search listings for missing ingredients | You want to make the first recipe you see. You are missing avocado. See if another user has some they are willing to give away | An important part of the app being useful to users is that they can find recipes to make and then if they’re missing ingredients, be able to find those ingredients from others which helps save food from going bad. |
| Buy the food from a listing | Acquire an avocado from a listing | We want to make sure the user understands that they need to send an email to the user to procure the food item |
| “Make” the recipe | You have decided to make the recipe. Update your ingredients to reflect that you used some of them | We want to see if the user notices that they can use the provided section to quickly see suggested food items to delete / decrement the quantity. |
| Logout | You’re done cooking/eating/grocery shopping for the day. Log out. | We want to make sure the user can easily find the logout form. |
| Login and recipe search | A day has passed and now you want to make a cake. Log in and find a recipe for a cake | Can the user find the login form easily? Do they know to navigate back to the recipe page and to type “cake” in the search box? |

## Observations

- The Prepared food checkbox is easy to miss - it's small and easy to forget to click, especially since it’s optional (PHYSICAL, MAJOR)
  - Possible fix: Change into a yes/no radio button that’s required
- It’s confusing that you can’t see others’ listings except in the recipe page (CONCEPTUAL, MINOR)
  - Possible fix: Add ‘All Listings’ page
- Communities is a confusing name, change to ‘Follows’, 'Food Circle', or something else (LINGUISTIC, MINOR)
- Suggested Recipes name does not portray you can also search for recipes on that tab (LINGUISTIC, MINOR)
  - Possible fix: Change to ‘Find Recipes’
- Food item’s quantity does not change when decreasing from recipes page (PHYSICAL, CRITICAL)
- ‘Want to make this recipe?’ section was unnecessary on the same page as the ingredient details since you can edit the quantities in the section for ingredients you have (PHYSICAL, MINOR)
  - Possible fix: Remove this section or move to recipe instructions page
- It is not clear that you have to follow communities to see listings (CONCEPTUAL, MAJOR)
  - Possible fixes: Popup when you create account, small description next to the view listings button, if ‘All Listings’ page is added then it could be described there
- Edit food layout is not stylistically pleasing (PHYSICAL, MINOR)
  - Possible fixes: Change text area to input box, replace create food form with edit food form when edit button is clicked (but how would this work when changing quantities from recipe page?)
- We should allow for editing food names such as to fix typos (PHYSICAL, MINOR)
- It is not clear why you needed an email to register (CONCEPTUAL/LINGUISTIC, MODERATE)
  - Possible fix: Add a message when creating the account stating that email will be used for others to contact you
- It was not clear that you would have to email people in order to claim a listing (CONCEPTUAL/LINGUISTIC, CRITICAL)
  - Possible Fixes: Change listing text to “email {{email}} to claim”
- “Create a food” was confusing language for adding an item to your stockpile (LINGUISTIC, MINOR)
  - Possible fix: Change title to “Add a food to your stockpile”
- It was confusing that units were optional (LINGUISTIC, MINOR)
  - Possible fix: instead of empty units, change option to “None”
- The suggest recipes button was initially missed (PHYSICAL, MODERATE)
  - Possible fix: Blue buttons with blue boxes are hard to see, change color of buttons or change color of components
- When click “View Listings”, multiple listings show up in columns (PHYSICAL, MINOR)
  - Fix: These should show up in a row
- Suggest making logout easily accessible from nav bar (PHYSICAL, MINOR)
- User was confused that only 5 recipes are suggested both when searching a general name and when suggesting (PHYSICAL, MINOR)
  - Possible fix: Add a “Show more” button
- There is not enough contrast between expired, expiring, and not expiring ingredients (PHYSICAL, MINOR)
  - Possible fix: Changing colors


## Summary of user testing

Our tester enjoyed the concept of the app, especially how recipes match to items in your stockpile. They thought it would be a useful app that they would use if they cooked. They expressed confusion over communities and how those relate to listings. It is not clear that the recommended listings are those of communities you follow. They also did not realize that to claim listings you would have to email the person whose contact info is displayed.

They initially looked at the “My Listings” page to create a listing and then the “Stockpile” page. They were surprised to find the “My Listings” page empty with no prompt on how to populate it with items for sale.

They liked the ingredient information appearing first when you select a recipe. They would have liked to know from the search page how many ingredients are missing in addition to the ingredients they have and how many are expiring.

We've come up with some possible fixes to each of these above, and will make decisions together about which to fix for our final build.
