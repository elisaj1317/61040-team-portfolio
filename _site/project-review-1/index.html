<p>This post is a peer review of the design ideas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV6lb4x029s">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="problem-definitions">Problem Definitions</h1>

<p>We think the problems presented are interesting, but when describing them you use terminology that the average person is not familiar with. For example, can you avoid words like “layers”, “masks”, “github”, and “forking”? Additionally, make sure to fully describe who is affected by your problem. For example, it is not clear if the first problem (editing art) is specific to digital art creators. Overall, it would be more compelling to the audience if data or real world experiences were used when describing the problem to help contextualize it. We agree that the problems you spoke about are real and interesting, but since they are not problems the typical person encounters, they need a longer description.</p>

<h1 id="app-1">App 1</h1>

<p>The concepts are clear, but there are ambiguities that make it hard to determine if the operational principles are easy to complete. For example, does the Asset concept depend on the user creating art using a custom editor created by your team? If so, will the user easily know how to use it from experience using other editors? How do subcomponents get assigned primitives? Does this concept also limit the art that the user can create using this app? The post concept seems to be an adjustment on the known post concept, so it is clear and easy for the user to execute. It seems from your design diagram that, in posts, assets have names. It could be useful for users to see what assets are associated with which subcomponents (potentially when hovering over a name).</p>

<p>We think there are details that are missing, but with a little editing the concepts could form a coherent app. It would also solve the stated problem. We wonder if this app be edited to be an addition to current art creation apps, potentially by supporting importing art created using other editors in some form.</p>

<h1 id="app-2">App 2</h1>

<p>Both the Style and Status concepts seem to be additional artist information. We wonder if they could potentially be an adjustment to the Profile concept rather than being two separate concepts. They seem to have easy operational principles, both Style and Status requiring a few button clicks to edit and view.</p>

<p>Overall, these concepts look like adjustments to the Profile concept. It also is not clear if it is enough to address the problem. In addition to style and status, artists would need a way to showcase their work. How would you describe the concept that allows artists to do so? Also, how would an artist find a client who is a good match with them? Is there any way to choose between two clients who have the same styles listed?</p>

<h1 id="app-3">App 3</h1>

<p>The Segmented Story concept is a little unclear. It is not described how a segmented story is created. It is also not clear from the purpose of this concept why a user would want to create a segmented story. The concept was not described enough to determine if its operational principle is likely to be easy for users to execute. The Forking concept is very interesting. It seems from the diagram that the user can easily fork with two clicks. However, like mentioned with the Segmented Story Concept, it is not clear from the written purpose of this concept why a user would want to fork a story.</p>

<p>Even with the mentioned additional concepts, there are more concepts that are missing in order to form a coherent app. For example, chapters should potentially be its own concept. When first watching the video, we wondered if segmented stories were just collection of chapter titles or if they also contain chapter contents. This confusion would be answered with a Chapter concept. This app would solve the stated problem (if all concepts were defined).</p>

<h1 id="overall-suggestions">Overall Suggestions</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid technical languages or references that the average person is not familiar with</li>
  <li>Include data or real world experiences to contextualize your problems</li>
  <li>Why should the average person care about the problem you are presenting?</li>
  <li>Make sure your concept purposes are not just concept definitions
    <ul>
      <li>Why would someone use your concept?</li>
      <li>What do they gain by using your concept?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure there are no major questions about how your app works left unanswered by your concepts</li>
  <li>Would a user actually use your app?
    <ul>
      <li>If it is a substitute, does it offer something that would encourage a user to switch?</li>
      <li>If it is in addition to existing apps, is it easy enough to use and solves a large enough problem that a user would add it to their routine?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We overall liked your ideas and are excited to see which one you decide to implement. Good luck!</p>
